# Star Wars Search App

This Angular application allows users to explore Star Wars films and find which starships, vehicles, or characters appear in each film.

Initially, it displays a list of Star Wars films with example data.

The top section contains a search form with three reusable input components for starships, vehicles, and characters.

Only one input field is mandatory at a time, and the search button activates when at least three characters are entered.

After searching, films featuring the selected item are highlighted.

Data is fetched from the Star Wars API (SWAPI). Bootstrap is used for styling.
